There are numbers in a board. The position of the number appears to be a important thing. Numbers will move all together, according to the move direction. When the player chose a move direction, for each number, the position at the chosen direction nearby the number is evaluated. If it is free, the number move at that position and still does not stop there, because it will move until there is a condition to stop. The number will stop if it will encounter the border of the board, or if it will encounter a number that can not be merge with itself. A moving number can merge with an another if the other number is stopped and was not merged.
